  <h1>Images</h1>
  <p>This page will cover some image formats. If you're looking for the
    <a href='links.html'>links</a> or the <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras</a>,
     you're on the wrong page, bud.</p>

  <h2>JPGs</h2>
  <p>JPG images are good for photos, but personally I like pngs better because
    those can be transparent.</p>

  <h2>GIFs</h2>
  <p>GIFs are cool, they're good for animations! Good for reaction stuff. Hey,
   if you want to start some Drama, ask someone how to pronounce GIF.</p>

  <h2>PNGs</h2>
  <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons and are clearly superior to jaypegs
    due to transparency capacity.</p>

  <h2>SVGs</h2>
  <p>SVGs are pretty darn cool. I've really only ever used them for class.
    Once. But they do seem very useful!</p>
