  <h1>Links</h1>
  <p>This is an example link right <a>here</a>. Except this one doesn't have an
    href so it's a bit of a useless anchor thing right now.</p>
  <p>Now, <em>this</em> one in this paragraph can actually link to
    <a href='images.html'>the images page</a> which is pretty cool.</p>
  <p>There are three kinds of links, listed below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Absolute</strong> links start with a <em>scheme</em> (like
      'https://'), have a <em>domain</em> (like 'developer.mozilla.org'), and
      a <em>path</em> (like '/en-us/docs/web/html').
      <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
        target='_blank'>This</a> is where that link leads to, in a new window
        or a new tab, depending on.</li>
    <li><strong>Relative</strong> links are... well, <a href='misc/extras.html'>
      this</a> example relative link leads to our extras page.</li>
    <li><strong>Root-relative</strong> links are kind of like relative links
      except they're relative to the "root" of the whole site instead of being
      relative to the current page. Normally, it could go to the <a href='/'>
      home</a> page, but it won't work for these local HTML files.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here's a cool tidbit: link hovertext can be manipulated with title, like
    for <a href='https://google.com' target='_blank'
    title='Hi, I am hovertext! This leads to Google.'>this link!</a> Hover over
    it and see! <small>They might be called tooltips? I'm not sure...</small></p>
