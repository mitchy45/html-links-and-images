  <h1>Extras</h1>

  <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you know what's better
    than random HTML things? <a href='../links.html'>This</a> page about links,
    or <a href='../images.html'>this</a> page about images!</p>

  <h2>Character Sets</h2>
  <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>bir</li>
    <li>iki</li>
    <li>üç</li>
    <li>dört</li>
    <li>beş</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
  <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
     should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
  yourself using curly quotes quite a bit. Look at all these different types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&ldquo;</li>
    <li>&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&lsquo;</li>
    <li>&rsquo;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I used to know some more cool tricks, but it's been a while since I used
  HTML. I vaguely remember that there was a&nbsp;space entity... I had to use
  a lot for a personal project so I memorized that one quickly. Guess I'll
  have to slowly relearn and remember the rest with this review!</p>
